        "hint": "This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:\nThe fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.\nIn a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.",

        "skill": "Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types",
        "lecture": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n",
        "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.\nA woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.\nA hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.",
