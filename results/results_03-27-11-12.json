They can make writing more expressive.\nAnaphora is the repetition of the same word or words at the beginning of several phrases or clauses.\nWe are united. We are powerful. We are winners.\nAntithesis involves contrasting opposing ideas within a parallel grammatical structure.\nI want to help, not to hurt.\nApostrophe is a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity.\nOh, little bird, what makes you sing so beautifully?\nAssonance is the repetition of a vowel sound in a series of nearby words.\nTry to light the fire.\nChiasmus is an expression in which the second half parallels the first but reverses the order of words.\nNever let a fool kiss you or a kiss fool you.\nUnderstatement involves deliberately representing something as less serious or important than it really is.\nAs you know, it can get a little cold in the Antarctic.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.",

How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",
